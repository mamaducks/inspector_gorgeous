            property inspections are a growing portion of the inspection
            industry. Evaluation of a commercial property has many of the same
            attributes as a residential home inspection. Our qualified
            inspectors will evaluate the property under the guidance of the
            nationally accepted Standards of Practice for Commercial Buildings.

            rot, or another type of destructive organism has worked its way into
            your house, and your home inspector will provide you with advice on
            how to handle the problem. icon_radon.jpg RADON TESTING WIN Home

            walking surfaces, access doors and fences, re-circulation equipment,
            and safety and emergency equipment is assessed. If significant
            issues are located on this thorough visual inspection, further
            evaluation and/or repair may be recommended. icon_sewer.jpg

            home owner's first line of defense to ensure that their home's
            drinking water is safe to drink ("potable"). The goal of the Air
            Quality Test is to test the quality of the air you breathe.
