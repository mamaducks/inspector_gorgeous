    Visible areas of all walls, ceilings, stairways
     are assessed for signs of leakage, damage, sagging,
      or other structural concerns. Inspectors check for leaning,
       cracked, or bowed walls, all of which may be signs of 
       defects in the foundation or underlying 
       structure of the home.  
       Termite damage is also on an inspectorâ€™s radar; peeling 
       or pitted paint may indicate termite damage underneath. 
       Your inspector will examine ceilings for cracks that may
        indicate structural problems as well as any signs that 
        moisture is getting into the ceiling from the attic or
         rooms above.  Sloping, uneven floors may mean the 
         structure underneath is damaged due to ground settling, 
         moisture, or termites.",
